# $PREON — ERC-20 native OFT utility token

$PREON is the protocol’s main utility token powered by LayerZero, giving users the ability to engage in secondary market activity, provide liquidity, and lock into $vePREON through the protocol’s veNFT contract.

# $vePREON — ERC-721 governance token in the form of an NFT

$vePREON is the vote-escrowed version of $PREON. Users can lock their $PREON tokens for up to 2 years to receive $vePREON.

$vePREON holders participate in protocol revenue sharing from various streams.

To encourage continuous locking and sustained participation from stakeholders, the $vePREON balance of users decays over time until it reaches zero at the conclusion of the initial locking period. $vePREON positions can be increased, split up, merged and resold on a secondary market.
