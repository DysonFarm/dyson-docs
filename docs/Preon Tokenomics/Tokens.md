Definitions & Concepts

# $PREON — ERC-20 native OFT utility token

$PREON is the protocol’s main utility token powered by LayerZero, giving users the ability to engage in secondary market activity, provide liquidity, and lock into $vePREON through the protocol’s veNFT contract.

$PREON’s initial mint supply: 500,000,000

$PREON has an elastic supply due to being an emissions token.

$PREON epochs will mint at start at 2% of initial supply or 10,000,000 $PREON 

The decay rate of emissions is set at 1%.

It is important to note that the Stability Pool will not receive all emitted tokens per epoch. 

The amount of tokens distributed to depositors is determined by TVL thresholds set by the team. These tokens are allotted to the Stability Pool. 

This is done to ensure fair and continuously incentivised growth and stability into the future and to avoid the funneling of rewards early on.  

Amount of participation and length of time participating should reward more than the timing of participation.  

Any unused emissions will be forwarded to a time of greater TVL and not used for anywhere else. 

***The TVL thresholds will be kept internal to negate gamification***.



# $vePREON — ERC-721 governance token in the form of an NFT

$vePREON is the vote-escrowed version of $PREON. Users can lock their $PREON tokens for up to 2 years to receive $vePREON.

$vePREON holders participate in protocol revenue sharing from various streams.

To encourage continuous locking and sustained participation from stakeholders, the $vePREON balance of users decays over time until it reaches zero at the conclusion of the initial locking period. $vePREON positions can be merged, extended, and transferred.
